# Connect 4 Game with Tkinter GUI

Simple Connect 4 game made in Python 3 with a Tkinter GUI. This was a personal project to learn how to program user interfaces in Python.

The game code itself was written by me in Python2 for my PHYS1201 Programming and Data Analysis module during my Physics Undergraduate degree. I modified it for Python3 and added the GUI after the module was complete.
